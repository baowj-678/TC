1667	There is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine .	3
1668	All-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us .	3
1670	A movie with a real anarchic flair .	3
7333	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .	1
7334	` A ' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy .	2
7335	If there 's one thing this world needs less of , it 's movies about college that are written and directed by people who could n't pass an entrance exam .	0
7336	The script kicks in , and Mr. Hartley 's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow .	1
7338	I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .	1
7339	No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .	1
7340	Looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen .	1
7341	In its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of Grease , without benefit of song .	0
7342	Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .	1
7343	It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .	1
7344	His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .	1
7345	Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .	2
7346	At times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there 's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .	1
7347	They should have called it Gutterball .	1
7348	Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .	3
7349	Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .	2
7350	It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .	1
7351	The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .	1
7352	Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .	1
7353	Slick piece of cross-promotion .	3
7354	Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .	0
7355	It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .	2
7356	It all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .	0
7359	It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .	1
7360	The techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are Chan and Hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we ca n't recommend anything but a rental for The Tuxedo .	2
7361	I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .	0
7362	Apart from dazzling cinematography , we 've seen just about everything in Blue Crush in one form or the other .	2
7363	Too much of the humor falls flat .	1
7364	Detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor .	1
7365	Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .	2
7366	The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .	1
7367	Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .	1
7369	No way I can believe this load of junk .	0
7371	It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .	0
7372	There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .	0
7373	Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .	0
7374	The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .	1
7375	But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?	2
7376	Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .	1
7377	And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .	1
7379	When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .	0
7380	Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny	2
7381	The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .	0
7382	The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .	0
7383	It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .	0
7384	This movie is maddening .	1
7385	It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .	2
7386	Should have been someone else -	1
7387	The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .	1
7388	Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?	0
7389	Would n't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?	2
7390	The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .	1
7391	Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .	1
7392	... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .	1
7393	I had to look away - this was god awful .	0
7394	Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .	2
7395	Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .	1
7396	Just one bad idea after another .	1
7397	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .	1
7398	Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .	1
7399	A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .	2
7400	Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .	1
7401	The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes	1
7402	It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .	1
7403	A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .	1
7404	Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .	0
7405	Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .	1
7406	It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .	1
7407	It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .	1
7408	Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .	1
7409	An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .	0
7410	This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .	0
7411	Hey Arnold !	2
7412	The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .	2
7413	This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .	0
7414	Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .	1
7415	Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .	1
7416	A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .	3
7417	If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .	1
7418	There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .	1
7419	It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .	0
7420	We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !	4
7421	Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .	0
7422	The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .	1
7423	The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .	2
7424	The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .	1
7425	The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .	2
7426	Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .	1
7427	Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '	0
7428	when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .	1
7429	While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .	2
7430	It treats women like idiots .	0
7431	Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .	2
7432	Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .	2
7433	A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .	1
7434	Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .	1
7435	For starters , the story is just too slim .	1
7436	So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .	3
7437	The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .	0
7438	The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .	2
7439	It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .	1
7440	Almost gags on its own gore .	0
7442	It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .	2
7443	The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .	0
7446	Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .	0
7447	Under 15 ?	2
7448	A giggle a minute .	4
7449	Over age 15 ?	2
7450	Big Fat Waste of Time .	0
7451	Hey Arnold !	2
7452	The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .	0
7453	Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .	1
7454	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .	0
7455	You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .	0
7456	In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .	1
7457	Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .	1
7458	Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .	0
7459	I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .	1
7460	While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .	2
7461	This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .	2
7462	Yes , Ballistic is silly .	2
7463	Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .	0
7464	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .	2
7465	The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .	1
7467	Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .	0
7468	Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .	1
7469	Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .	1
7470	Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .	1
7471	K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .	0
7472	Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence	2
7473	A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .	2
7474	Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .	0
7475	Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .	1
7476	The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .	1
7477	The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .	0
7478	Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .	0
7479	Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .	1
7480	It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .	2
7481	Holden Caulfield did it better .	1
7482	A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .	1
7483	Oh come on .	1
7484	Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .	0
7485	If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .	2
7486	Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .	2
7487	Not exactly the Bees Knees	1
7488	It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .	1
7489	The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .	2
7490	Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .	2
7491	The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .	1
7492	Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .	2
7493	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .	2
7494	Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .	1
7495	It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .	0
7496	This is nothing but familiar territory .	2
7497	In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .	1
7498	One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .	0
7499	A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .	1
7500	Too slow , too long and too little happens .	1
7501	The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .	0
7502	It 's just filler .	1
7503	Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .	1
7504	Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .	1
7505	A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .	1
7506	Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .	0
7507	It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .	1
7508	They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .	2
7509	Barely gets off the ground .	2
7510	Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .	1
7511	Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .	1
7512	At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .	3
7513	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	0
7514	From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .	1
7515	It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .	0
7516	On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .	2
7519	By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .	1
7520	Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .	0
7521	Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .	2
7522	Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .	1
7523	Do not see this film .	1
7524	Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .	3
7525	Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .	1
7526	If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .	1
7527	To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .	1
7528	In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .	0
7529	If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .	2
7530	I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .	1
7531	Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .	2
7533	While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .	1
7534	For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .	1
7535	To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .	2
7536	What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .	1
7537	In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .	1
7538	It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .	0
7539	Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .	2
7540	... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .	1
7541	It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .	1
7542	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .	0
7543	Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .	0
7544	A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .	0
7546	The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .	0
7547	What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''	2
7548	All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .	1
7549	A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .	1
7550	So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .	0
7551	What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .	1
7552	A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .	2
7553	For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .	1
7554	A coarse and stupid gross-out .	1
7555	a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .	1
7556	Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .	1
7557	There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .	2
7558	It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .	0
7559	The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .	2
7561	Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .	1
7562	Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .	1
7563	Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .	0
7564	That 's a cheat .	1
7565	Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .	3
7566	This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .	0
7567	A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .	1
7568	The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .	1
7570	Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .	1
7571	An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .	2
7572	It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .	3
7573	`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .	0
7574	It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .	0
7575	... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .	1
7576	A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .	2
7577	It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''	2
7578	columns from Ladies Home Journal ...	2
7579	The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .	2
7580	I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .	2
7581	It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .	3
7582	Socrates motions for hemlock .	2
7584	Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .	2
7585	It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .	1
7586	It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .	2
7587	Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .	2
7588	I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .	1
7589	Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .	2
7590	Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .	0
7591	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .	2
7592	I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .	1
7598	For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .	1
7599	Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .	0
7600	Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .	0
7601	The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .	2
7602	Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .	1
7603	A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .	1
7604	This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .	1
7605	There can be no other explanation .	2
7606	Hilariously inept and ridiculous .	3
7607	Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .	1
7609	Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .	1
7610	Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .	0
7611	a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground	1
7612	A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .	1
7613	Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .	1
7614	Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .	2
7615	For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .	3
7616	With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .	0
7617	It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .	1
7618	Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .	1
7621	All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .	1
7622	No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .	0
7623	Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .	1
7624	There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .	1
7625	It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .	2
7626	Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .	3
7627	Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .	1
7628	More maudlin than sharp .	2
7630	It 's slow -- very , very slow .	0
7631	It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .	1
7632	That 's pure PR hype .	1
7633	Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .	1
7634	Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .	1
7635	Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .	1
7636	Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .	0
7637	There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .	1
7638	If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .	2
7639	I do n't think I laughed out loud once .	0
7640	And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .	0
7641	It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .	1
7642	Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?	0
7643	... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .	0
7644	The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .	0
7645	My reaction in a word : disappointment .	0
7646	His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .	0
7647	It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .	2
7648	Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .	1
7649	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	3
7650	Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .	0
7651	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .	1
7653	I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .	1
7654	The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .	2
7655	A workshop mentality prevails .	2
7656	It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .	0
7657	Yes , dull .	0
7658	Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .	2
7659	Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .	1
7661	Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .	1
7662	This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .	0
7663	An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .	1
7664	A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...	0
7665	It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .	2
7666	As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .	0
7667	New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .	2
7670	The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .	1
7671	Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .	2
7672	While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .	2
7673	As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .	1
7674	This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .	1
7675	This is her Blue Lagoon .	2
7676	The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .	1
7678	Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .	1
7679	An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .	1
7680	Has all the depth of a wading pool .	0
7681	This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .	1
7683	... the movie is just a plain old monster .	0
7684	If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .	2
7685	One long string of cliches .	1
7686	Fancy a real downer ?	1
7688	Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .	0
7689	Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .	0
7690	Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .	2
7691	But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .	2
7692	At once half-baked and overheated .	1
7693	There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .	2
7694	I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .	2
7696	It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .	1
7697	By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .	2
7698	Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .	1
7700	Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .	1
7701	Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .	2
7702	Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?	1
7703	The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .	1
7704	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .	1
7705	A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .	2
7706	... think of it as American Pie On Valium .	2
7707	Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .	0
7710	It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .	0
7711	With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .	1
7712	Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/	2
7713	Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .	2
7714	For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .	2
7715	No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .	1
7716	This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .	0
7717	Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .	2
7718	This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .	2
7719	It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .	1
7720	As vulgar as it is banal .	1
7721	You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .	1
7722	The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .	1
7723	The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .	1
7724	More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .	1
7727	Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .	0
7728	Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .	1
7729	A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .	1
7730	Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .	1
7731	A sometimes tedious film .	1
7732	Teen movies have really hit the skids .	1
7733	There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .	0
7734	... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .	1
7735	Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .	2
7736	What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .	0
7737	does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters	3
7738	It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .	2
7739	just not campy enough	1
7740	The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .	1
7741	It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .	0
7742	Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .	1
7743	The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .	0
7744	For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .	0
7745	American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize .	1
7746	And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .	1
7747	It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .	1
7748	Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .	1
7749	... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .	0
7750	So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises	0
7751	Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .	1
7752	Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .	0
7753	It 's a buggy drag .	1
7754	Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .	1
7755	The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .	1
7756	Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .	0
7757	Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .	0
7758	Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .	0
7759	A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .	0
7760	There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .	0
7761	The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .	3
7762	Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .	2
7763	... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .	1
7764	Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .	0
7765	I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .	1
7766	There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .	1
7768	Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .	1
7770	A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .	0
7771	Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal	0
7772	... routine , harmless diversion and little else .	3
7773	Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .	1
7774	This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .	1
7775	While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer	3
7776	It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .	1
7777	Let 's hope -- shall we ?	2
7782	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .	1
7783	If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .	1
7784	In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .	0
7785	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .	1
7786	But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?	1
7787	Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .	0
7788	It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .	1
7789	Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .	1
7790	Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .	0
7791	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .	1
7792	Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .	1
7793	A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .	3
7794	Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .	1
7795	To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .	1
7796	At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .	1
7797	The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .	2
7798	As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .	0
7799	The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .	0
7800	There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .	1
7801	With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .	2
7802	It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	1
7803	Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .	2
7804	The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	1
7805	One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .	1
7806	Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	1
7807	The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	0
7808	With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	1
7809	Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .	0
7810	A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .	0
7811	Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .	2
7812	It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .	2
7813	The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .	1
7814	Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .	1
7815	Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .	1
7816	I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .	2
7817	Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	1
7818	Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	1
7819	Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .	3
7820	It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	1
7821	On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	0
7822	The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .	1
7823	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	1
7824	Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	0
7825	The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	1
7826	Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .	1
7827	It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .	1
7828	Bad .	1
7829	Very bad .	0
7830	Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	0
7831	May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .	1
7832	If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .	1
7833	Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .	1
7834	The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .	1
7835	Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .	1
7836	The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .	0
7837	The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .	2
7838	Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .	1
7839	Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .	2
7840	But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	1
7841	Long Time Dead ?	2
7842	Not nearly long enough .	2
7843	Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .	2
7844	A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .	3
7845	There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .	1
7846	The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .	1
7847	Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .	1
7848	Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .	1
7849	McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .	3
7850	An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .	1
7851	Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .	2
7852	Who needs love like this ?	2
7853	Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .	1
7854	Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .	2
7855	Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .	2
7856	Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .	0
7857	Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .	0
7858	It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	1
7859	Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .	2
7860	It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .	1
7861	A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .	1
7862	Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .	0
7863	I 'm just too bored to care .	1
7864	Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .	1
7866	As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .	2
7867	Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .	1
7868	It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .	0
7869	Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .	1
7870	Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .	1
7871	A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .	2
7872	Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?	0
7873	This is so bad .	0
7874	Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .	2
7875	I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .	2
7876	Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .	1
7877	This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	1
7878	The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	1
7879	It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .	1
7880	The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .	0
7881	Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '	2
7882	At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .	1
7883	A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .	1
7884	The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .	1
7885	The end result is a film that 's neither .	1
7886	Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .	1
7887	Something like scrubbing the toilet .	1
7888	Or emptying rat traps .	1
7889	Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .	1
7890	Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .	3
7891	\/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !	1
7892	Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?	1
7893	There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .	1
